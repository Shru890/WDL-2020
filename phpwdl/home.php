      <p>Novel coronavirus (nCoV) is a provisional name given to coronaviruses of medical significance before a permanent name is decided upon. Although coronaviruses are endemic in humans and infections normally mild, such as the common cold (caused by human coronaviruses in ~15% of cases), cross-species transmission has produced some unusually virulent strains which can cause viral pneumonia and in serious cases even acute respiratory distress syndrome and death.===><a href="awareness.php">for more info click here</a></p>

      <p>Short-term response measures to address the health emergency and secure core public services will need to be accompanied by comprehensive policies to boost long-term growth, including by improving governance and business environments, and expanding and improving the results of investment in education and public health. To make future economies more resilient, many countries will need systems that can build and retain more human and physical capital during the recovery â€“ using policies that reflect and encourage the post-pandemic need for new types of jobs, businesses and governance systems.===><a href="https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/?utm_campaign=homeAdUOA?Si">for more info click here</a></p>
